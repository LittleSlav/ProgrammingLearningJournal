First issue I came across was due to an autofill in visual studio without me noticing. As you can see in the images below, I inteded to write "Animation", and it changed it to the title of the script, which is "LightFlickerAnimation"

Then trying to test it out, it was not working, the mistake was putting the script on both the main object and on the light effect. After deleting the script component on the light source.

#The fix


After fixing the previous issue, I've noticed another missed detail. In the script for the animation, that is now attached to the main object only, had no Game Object selected for "Lamp Lights" which was a quick drag-and-drop fix.
